# Changing Demographics in the Democratic Coalition

This Project was completed in December of 2020 for a class at the University of Pennsylvania, PSCI 107: Introduction to Data Science. It explores, as the title suggests, changing demographics in the Democratic coalition. The assignment was meant to represent the results of my data analysis in a succinct, clear, 538-style article. 

The Code and Data Folder contains all of the code and data needed to produce figures and values used in the report. First, run the DataCleaning Script, then the FinalAnalysis Script. The DataCleaning script draws on data from the Data Folder, and outputs into the Clean Data folder. The FinalAnalysis script draws on data from the Clean Data Folder and outputs into the Figures Folder. The PDF is the final paper that was written based on the analysis and figures!

When running the R Scripts, make sure you change the working directory so it directs to where you have downloaded the files onto your computer.  For example, setwd("~/downloads/psci-107-project/Code & Data/Figures/")
